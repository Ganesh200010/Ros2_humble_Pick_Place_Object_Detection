# Ros2_humble

ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for developing robotic systems. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that aid in building robot applications. ROS2 is designed to be more scalable, distributed, and real-time capable compared to its predecessor, ROS.

# 1.1 Pick & Place
Pick-and-place is a common robotic task where a robot arm picks up an object from one location and places it in another. The arm's movement can be controlled using inverse kinematics, which involves calculating the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position

# 1.2 Object Detection

Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects within an image or a point cloud. ROS2 provides several packages and libraries that can be used for object detection tasks

-	Ensure proper sensor calibration to achieve accurate object detection results.

# 2. Environment Setup
   
The project uses [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) running on [Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/)

The following tools are used for simulation and motion planning:

- [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home): A physics-based 3D simulator extensively used in the robotics world.
- [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz): A 3D visualizer for sensor data analysis and robot state visualization.
