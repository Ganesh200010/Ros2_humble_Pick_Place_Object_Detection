# Ros2_humble
ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for developing robotic systems. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and conventions that aid in building robot applications. ROS2 is designed to be more scalable, distributed, and real-time capable compared to its predecessor, ROS.

# Pick & Place
Pick-and-place is a common robotic task where a robot arm picks up an object from one location and places it in another. The arm's movement can be controlled using inverse kinematics, which involves calculating the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position
